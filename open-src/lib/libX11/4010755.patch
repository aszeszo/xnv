4010755: SEGV in XFindContext if XInitThreads has been enabled

XFindContext in Xlib was calling _XLockMutex with an uninitialized
mutex lock structure. The new version of XInitThreads activates the
locking functions at any time, even after displays have been created.

In this new case, the context structure was created prior to
XInitThreads being invoked. As a result, the display contained an
opaque pointer to this context structure, which still contained an
uninitialized lock structure.

The solution was to explicitly set the lock structure pointer to NULL
(as a flag) when creating the context, then check for NULL when
locking. If NULL is found and threads are now enabled, then the
structure gets reinitialized to the correct mutex lock structure
in the lock call.

Another area besides the functions in Context.c are the functions in
Xrm.c. A similar fix was added to them as well.
