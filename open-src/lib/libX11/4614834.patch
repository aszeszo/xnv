4614834: Xlib color functions are not MT-safe

In a multithreaded Xlib client:

    * concurrent access to XAllocNamedColor() make the client crash
    * concurrent access to XLookupColor() make the client crash

The cause of the problem is that in multithread environment some data
in XLookupColor() and XAllocNamedColor() can be accessed/modified at
same time by multi threads. Adding some lock and unlock code to make
sure only one thread can access the data at one time fixed the
problem.
