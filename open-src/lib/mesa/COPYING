                                  Disclaimer

   Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to
   that of [1]OpenGL.* To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL
   command syntax or state machine, it is being used with authorization
   from [2]Silicon Graphics, Inc.(SGI). However, the author does not
   possess an OpenGL license from SGI, and makes no claim that Mesa is in
   any way a compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with SGI.
   Those who want a licensed implementation of OpenGL should contact a
   licensed vendor.

   Please do not refer to the library as MesaGL (for legal reasons). It's
   just Mesa or The Mesa 3-D graphics library.

   * OpenGL is a trademark of [3]Silicon Graphics Incorporated.
