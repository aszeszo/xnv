 * The overlay adaptor supports the following chipsets:
 *  SiS300: No registers >0x65, two overlays (one used for CRT1, one for CRT2)
 *  SiS630/730: No registers >0x6b, two overlays (one used for CRT1, one for CRT2)
 *  SiS550: Full register range, two overlays (one used for CRT1, one for CRT2)
 *  SiS315: Full register range, one overlay (used for both CRT1 and CRT2 alt.)
 *  SiS650/740: Full register range, one overlay (used for both CRT1 and CRT2 alt.)
 *  SiSM650/651: Full register range, two overlays (one used for CRT1, one for CRT2)
 *  SiS330: Full register range, one overlay (used for both CRT1 and CRT2 alt.)
 *  SiS661/741/760: Full register range, two overlays (one used for CRT1, one for CRT2)
 *  SiS340: - ? overlays. Extended registers for DDA.
 *  SiS761: - ? overlays. Extended registers for DDA.
 *  XGI Volari V3XT/V5/V8: 1 Overlay. Extended registers for DDA.
 *
 * Help for reading the code:
 * 315/550/650/740/M650/651/330/661/741/76x/340/XGI = SIS_315_VGA
 * 300/630/730                                      = SIS_300_VGA
 * For chipsets with 2 overlays, hasTwoOverlays will be true
 *
 * Notes on display modes:
 *
 * -) dual head mode:
 *    DISPMODE is either SINGLE1 or SINGLE2, hence you need to check dualHeadMode flag
 *    DISPMODE is _never_ MIRROR.
 *    a) Chipsets with 2 overlays:
 *       315/330 series: Only half sized overlays available (width 960), 660: 1536
 *       Overlay 1 is used on CRT1, overlay 2 for CRT2.
 *    b) Chipsets with 1 overlay:
 *       Full size overlays available.
 *       Overlay is used for either CRT1 or CRT2
 * -) merged fb mode:
 *    a) Chipsets with 2 overlays:
 *       315/330 series: Only half sized overlays available (width 960), 660: 1536
 *       DISPMODE is always MIRROR. Overlay 1 is used for CRT1, overlay 2 for CRT2.
 *    b) Chipsets with 1 overlay:
 *       Full size overlays available.
 *       DISPMODE is either SINGLE1 or SINGLE2. Overlay is used accordingly on either
 *       CRT1 or CRT2 (automatically, where it is located)
 * -) mirror mode (without dualhead or mergedfb)
 *    a) Chipsets with 2 overlays:
 *       315/330 series: Only half sized overlays available (width 960), 660: 1536
 *       DISPMODE is MIRROR. Overlay 1 is used for CRT1, overlay 2 for CRT2.
 *    b) Chipsets with 1 overlay:
 *       Full size overlays available.
 *       DISPMODE is either SINGLE1 or SINGLE2. Overlay is used depending on
 * 	 XvOnCRT2 flag.
 *
 * About the video blitter:
 * The video blitter adaptor supports 16 ports. By default, adaptor 0 will
 * be the overlay adaptor, adaptor 1 the video blitter. The option XvDefaultAdaptor
 * allows reversing this.
 * Since SiS does not provide information on the 3D engine, I could not
 * implement scaling. Instead, the driver paints a black border around the unscaled
 * video if the destination area is bigger than the video.
