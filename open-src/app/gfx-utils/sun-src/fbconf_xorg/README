The fbconf_xorg/src directory contains these Makefiles:

    Makefile        Master Makefile, builds fbconf_xorg(1M), et. al.
    Makefile.common Common definitions, included by all other Makefile.* files
    Makefile.fbc    Builds libfbconf_xorg.so.1 for fbconf_xorg(1M)
    Makefile.gfx    Builds gfx/libgfx.a as a stripped-down, PIC version
    Makefile.xf86   Builds xf86/libxf86conf.a, the open source XFree86 parser

    Makefile.<xfb>  Builds libSUNW<xfb>_conf.so.1 for <xfb>


To implement a new libSUNW<xfb>_conf.so.1 shared library for a new <xfb>
frame buffer device:

    Create the fbconf_xorg/<xfb> source directory.

    Start populating the new source directory by creating
        fbconf_xorg/<xfb>/<xfb>_properties.c
    and
        fbconf_xorg/<xfb>/<xfb>_properties.h,
    based on existing examples, such as in fbconf_xorg/efb.
    Prominent details will be:
        SUNW<xfb>_api_version
                API version number (prominent but trivial)
        <xfb>_option[]
                Command line option descriptors
                (see fbopt_descr_t, etc. in fbc_getargs.h)
        <xfb>_propt_fn[]
                -propt display function addresses
                (see fbc_propt.c)
        SUNW<xfb>_get_properties()
                Initialization function for the <xfb> varient of
                fbconfig_xorg(1M)
                (see fbc_varient_t in fbc_properties.h)

    Repeat the process with other fbconf_xorg/<xfb>/*.[ch] sources
    as needed, until all of the anticipated symbols have been defined
    and the intended <xfb> functionality has been implemented.

    When it makes sense, move sufficiently common code into
    fbconf_xorg/fbc to be incorporated into libfbconf_xorg.so.1 (or
    into fbconf_xorg, if the code isn't referenced from a shared
    library).

    Create a fbconf_xorg/Makefile.<xfb> makefile.  Invoke it from
    fbconf_xorg/Makefile, following existing examples.  Update
    fbconf_xorg/Makefile.common as necessary.
