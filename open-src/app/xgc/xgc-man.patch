 The
 .I xgc
 program demonstrates various features of the X graphics primitives.
-Try the buttons, see what they do; we haven't the time to document
-them, perhaps you do?
+In X, most of the details about the graphics to be generated are
+stored in a resource called a graphics context (GC).  The 
+.B xgc
+program provides a user interface for setting various GC components.
+Pressing the "Run" button causes these results to be displayed in
+the large drawing window on the right.  Timing information is
+displayed in the window immediately below.
+.PP
+The items in the upper left hand window work as follows:
+.PP
+.I Function
+\- specify the logical function with which primitives
+will drawn.  The most usual setting is "set", i.e. simply to render
+pixels without regard to what has been drawn before.
+.PP
+.I LineStyle
+\- specify whether lines should be drawn solid in foreground,
+dashed in foreground or alternating foreground and background.
+.PP
+.I CapStyle
+\- specify the appearance of the ends of a line.
+.PP
+.I JoinStyle
+\- specify the appearance of joints between consecutive
+lines drawn within a single graphics primitive.
+.PP
+.I FillStyle
+\- specify whether lines, text and fill requests are
+solid, tiled with a pixmap or stippled.
+.PP
+.I FillRule
+\- specifies the rule used to fill polygons.  The EvenOdd
+rule means that if areas overlap an odd number of times, they are not
+drawn.  Winding rule means that overlapping areas are always filled, 
+regardless of how many times they overlap.
+.PP
+.I ArcMode
+\- specifies the rule for filling of arcs.  The boundary
+of the arc is either a Chord or two radii.
+.PP
+.I planemask
+\- specifies which planes of the drawing window are 
+modified.  By default, all planes are modified.
+.PP
+.I dashlist
+\- specifies a pattern to be used when drawing dashed lines.
+.PP
+.I Line Width
+\- specifies the width in pixels of lines to be drawn.
+Zero means to draw using the server's fastest algorithm with a line width of
+one pixel.
+.PP
+.I Font
+\- specifies the font to be used for text primitives.
+.PP
+.I Foreground
+and
+.I Background
+\- specify the pixel values to be
+applied when drawing primitives.  
+The Foreground value is used as the
+pixel value for set bits in the source in all primitives.
+The Background value is used as the
+pixel value for unset bits in the source when using Copy Plane, drawing
+lines with LineStyle of DoubleDash and filling with FillStyle of
+OpaqueStippled.
+.PP
+.I Percentage of Test
+\- scrollbar permits specifying only
+a percentage of the test to be run.  The number at the left indicates
+the current setting, which defaults to 100%.
+.sp 
+The window labeled "Test" permits choice of one a number of graphics
+primitive tests, including Points, Segments, Lines, Arcs and Filled Arcs,
+8-bit Text and Image Text, Rectangles and Filled Rectangles, Image draws,
+as well as Copy Plane and Copy Area.
+.PP
+The window to the right of this has buttons which permit record/playback
+of the primitives rendered.
