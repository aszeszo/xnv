Subject: [PATCH] dri2: SProcDRI2Connect - send the response.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The swapped implementation of DRI2Connect is always responding with empty
device and driver values. However the response was only prepared and never
sent (also had undefined .type member), causing e.g. glxinfo get stuck waiting
for response when started remotely from machine with different endianity.
