# This file has no user serviceable parts.
#
# If you need to override any value, do not edit it here.  Instead,
# set the values in your build environment.  If you do this, it must
# be an integer, and your choice will have ramifications on whether or
# not the package repositories you build will be upgradable.
#

#
# Package Version Information
#
# The package version is described in detail within the pkg(5) man page.
# It is made of four components. The values within this file set the
# third component, the branch version, which resides after the dash.
# 
# This component needs to accommodate the following:
#
# o uniquely identifying individual builds to support zone
#   install/update
#
# o for the continued movement forwards when Solaris updates,
#   bug fixes and other requirements are delivered.
#
# The package branch version scheme is:
#
#       trunk_id.update.SRU.platform.buildid.nightlyid
#
# where
#       trunk_id : build number for tip development gate, with leading 0
#       update   : 0 for FCS, 1 for update 1, etc.
#       SRU      : SRU (support repository update) number for this update
#       platform : reserved for future use.
#       buildid  : the build number of the last non-zero element from above
#       nightlyid: nightly build identifier
#
# This scheme is used below.
#

#
# Generate various ids of the packages from the tag in the gate.
# In X the Nevada builds were tagged with nv_XXX where XXX is the
# build/trunk number.
#
# When the next development train is started this pattern will need to be
# uncommented & changed in order to match the tag used there:
#
# TRUNKID :sh = hg parent --template '{latesttag}\n' | \
#        perl -l -n -e 'if ($_ =~ m/^nv_(\d+)/) {print $1} else {exit 1}'

# If you get mksh: Fatal error from the above, then you have an unexpected
# tag other than nv_XXX in your hg repo.   You can run make TRUNKID=123 to
# override with a different build id until you fix your repo or this regexp.

# For Solaris 11 updates, the TRUNKID is always 175, since that's the build
# we branched the updates at.
TRUNKID= 175

#
# The Solaris Update number. This will be set by the gatekeepers.
# The value must match the update number of the release.
#
# Uncomment for development train:
# UPDATENUM= 0

# For Solaris 11 updates, the update number is part of the tag (s11u1_01 for
# instance):
UPDATENUM:sh = hg parent --template '{latesttag}\n' | \
        perl -l -n -e 'if ($_ =~ m/^s11u(\d+)_/) {print $1} else {exit 1}'

#
# Support Respository Update number. This is here to reserve space within the
# version string. Typically it should not be set unless all the packages
# are being delivered within an SRU.
#
SRUNUM= 0

#
# Platform number. This is here to reserve space within the version
# string. It should not be set unless there is a specific need to
# release a platform update while the Solaris Update is being built.
#
PLATNUM= 0

#
# Build Identifier. Used to indicate which build (or respin for
# the development build) of the Solaris Update is being built. 
# This is set by the gatekeepers.
#
# Uncomment for development train:
# BUILDID= 0

# For Solaris 11 updates, the build number is part of the tag (s11u1_01 for
# instance):
BUILDID:sh = hg parent --template '{latesttag}\n' | \
        perl -l -n -e 'if ($_ =~ m/^s11u\d+_0*(\d+)/) {print $1} else {exit 1}'

#
# Each (nightly) build of the code that produces packages needs to
# be uniquely identified so that packages produced by different
# builds can't be mixed.  Mixing packages from different builds can
# easily result in broken global and nonglobal zones.
#
# Generate the identifier based upon the changeset id's of the gate.
#
# Note: :sh is used for the finding the values because it is evaluated
# once during the package build.
#
NIGHTLYID		:sh = (hg parent --template '{rev}\n')
